# snakes_and_ladder
It's a famous game of Snakes and Ladder by rolling dice.
# Rules:
It's a game played by 2 players on a board numbered from 1 to 100.
There are several ladders and snakes.
While you land at the bottom of the ladder by rolling the dice and adding the number displayed by the dice, you climb the ladder and upgrade your points.
Similarly, while you land at the top of the snake, you slip down to the bottom of the snake.
This way one needs to reach exactly at 100.
If one goes more than 100, then the last roll of dice becomes invalid and the number remains below 100 where it was handing over the turn to the other player.
# Code:
The code is simple with all the information of ladders and snakes.
Each player gets the chance to roll by pressing 1 and thereby see their luck of winning the game.
# Extensions:
Two more codes are included:
1. To count the number of snakes and ladders in the playing board.
2. To find whether the sequence of numbers by the rolling dice is having the winning combination or not.
# Happy coding
